# What is Communism

Communism is a political and economic system that seeks to create a classless society in which the major means of production, 
such as mines and factories, are owned and controlled by the public. There is no government or private property or currency, 
and the wealth is divided among citizens equally or according to individual need.  

# What is Mlmism

Mlmism or MLM is short for [Marxism–Leninism–Maoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism%E2%80%93Maoism), 
which is a political philosophy that synthesizes and builds upon Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. 
Marxism–Leninism–Maoism was first formalized by the Shining Path in 1982.  

The synthesis of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism did not occur during the life of Mao Zedong. From the 1960s, groups that called 
themselves Maoist or which upheld Maoism were not unified around a common understanding of Maoism and had instead their 
own particular interpretations of the political, philosophical, economical and military works of Mao; these disorganized 
ideological trends comprised, and still comprise, Mao Zedong Thought. Adherents of Marxism–Leninism–Maoism claim it to be 
a unified, coherent higher stage of Marxism and that it was not synthesized until the 1980s through the experience of the 
people's war waged by the Shining Path in Peru. This led the Shining Path to posit Marxism–Leninism–Maoism as the newest 
development of Marxism.  

Marxism–Leninism–Maoism has grown and developed significantly, serving as an animating force of revolutionary movements in 
countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, India, Nepal and the Philippines. It has also led to efforts being undertaken 
towards the constitution or reconstitution of communist parties in countries such as Austria, France, Germany, Sweden and 
the United States.[clarification needed] There are several non-party Maoist organizations in many countries, such as Tjen 
Folket in Norway and the Red Guards in the United States. The International Communist League is a modern coalition of 
multinational organizations subscribing to MLM ideology.

***NOTE:***
Mlmism is not the same as [Marxism-Leninism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marxism%E2%80%93Leninism) or [Maoism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maoism).
