Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung (simplified Chinese: 毛主席语录; traditional Chinese: 毛主席語錄; pinyin: Máo Zhǔxí Yǔlù) 
is a book of statements from speeches and writings by Mao Zedong (formerly romanized as Mao Tse-tung), the former chairman of 
the Chinese Communist Party, published from 1964 to 1979 and widely distributed during the Cultural Revolution.  

The most popular versions were printed in small sizes that could be easily carried and were bound in bright red covers, thus 
commonly becoming known internationally as the "Little Red Book".
